<p>Suppose a librarian is tasked with weeding a section of physical books. As part of the decision making process, he/she wants to consider what other libraries in the area might own that specific item.
The librarian wants to peruse the stacks with a laptop and barcode reader, and get this information by scanning a book's barcode. You have been tasked with creating a web interface to make this a reality.

  <p>It's useful to break this problem down into these questions:
  <ul>
  	<li>What do I have?</li>
  	<li>How can I get what I need with what I have?</li>
  </ul>
	In this application, we start with a barcode.
