<p>Suppose a librarian is tasked with weeding a section of physical books. As part of the decision making process, he/she wants to consider what other libraries in the area might own that specific item.
The librarian wants to peruse the stacks with a laptop and barcode reader, and get this information by scanning a book's barcode. You have been tasked with creating a web interface to make this a reality.

  <p>It's useful to break this problem down into these questions:
  <ul>
  	<li>What do I have?</li>
  	<li>How can I get what I need with what I have?</li>
  </ul>
	In this application, we start with a barcode, and eventually want to end up with a list of regional libraries that own this item.
	There is no single Alma API that currently does this. However, we can use the <a href='https://developers.exlibrisgroup.com/blog/Scan-in-and-Next-Step-APIs' target='_blank'>Alma Scan In API</a> to retrieve Bib/Items/Holdings data, including ISBN, from a barcode.
	We can then use the Worldcat Search API to get local libraries with our ISBN, using the <a href='https://platform.worldcat.org/api-explorer/wcapi/LibraryLocations/GetByISBN' target='_blank'>LibraryLocations GetByISBN</a> method.
